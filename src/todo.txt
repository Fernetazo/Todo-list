TO DO:
    Add support local saving
    UI
    Placeholder in grey when editing or adding new task
    Find visual bug when adding new projects, the divs goes up each time
    Add date-fns to webpack config (its working, maybe? check after final push in github live preview)
    Add restrictions between user's action (dont let user add new task when editing)
